# My Vim Configuration

Main features:

* Sublime-like "find in files" search
* Unite-powered fuzzy file search and most recently used list
* Windows which auto-maximize vertically
* A large number of custom remappings

## Setup

Run `~/install.sh`, which will set up symlinks for `~/.vimrc` and `~/.vim` to
directories here.

For now, my sublime-like search depends on a couple of custom scripts (in the
`scripts` directory).

Plugins will be installed via Neobundle once you start vim.
